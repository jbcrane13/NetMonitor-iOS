## For AI Agents

### Working In This Directory
- Reference the PRD (`NetMonitor iOS Companion - Product Requirements Document.md`) when clarifying feature requirements
- Check `IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md` for architectural decisions, tech stack rationale, and implementation patterns
- Review `plans/` for dated design documents related to major features

### Documentation Standards
- New design documents should be added to `plans/` with `YYYY-MM-DD-description.md` naming
- Keep PRD and implementation plan in sync with actual implementation
- Screenshots should be placed in `screenshots/` subdirectory
