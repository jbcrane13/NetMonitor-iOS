# Privacy Policy

**NetMonitor**
**Effective Date:** February 11, 2026

## Overview

NetMonitor is a network monitoring and diagnostic tool for iOS. Your privacy matters — this app is designed to keep all data on your device.

## Data Collection

**NetMonitor does not collect, transmit, or store any personal data on external servers.**

All data generated by the app — including tool results, device information, speed test measurements, and monitoring targets — is stored locally on your device using Apple's SwiftData framework.

## Network Access

NetMonitor accesses the network solely to perform the diagnostic functions you initiate:

- **Diagnostic tools** (ping, traceroute, DNS lookup, WHOIS, port scanning, speed test) directed at hosts you specify
- **Device discovery** via Bonjour on your local network
- **Wake on LAN** packets sent to devices you choose
- **Web browser** tool for URLs you navigate to

No data from these operations is sent to the developer or any third party.

## Mac Companion

NetMonitor can pair with NetMonitor Pro on your Mac over your local network. This communication stays entirely within your local network and is used to sync device data and monitoring status.

## Background Activity

NetMonitor may perform background refresh tasks to keep network data up to date and sync with a paired Mac. These tasks run locally and do not transmit data externally.

## Widgets

The NetMonitor widget displays network status information. All widget data is sourced locally from the app's on-device storage.

## Analytics & Tracking

NetMonitor does not include any analytics frameworks, crash reporting services, advertising SDKs, or tracking technologies.

## Third-Party Services

NetMonitor does not integrate with any third-party data services.

## Data Storage

All app data is stored on your device. You can delete all data by removing the app.

## Changes to This Policy

If this policy changes, the updated version will be posted here with a new effective date.
